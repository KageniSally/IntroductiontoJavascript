/*1. Password Validation:
 
Imagine a program where users create accounts. You want to make sure their passwords are strong and not easily guessed.
 This function checks if a password follows these guidelines:
 
It cannot be blank (empty).
It cannot contain repeated characters in a row (like "1111" or "aaaaa" or "Jjjj").
Optionally, you can add a list of common words that users shouldn't use as passwords (like "password" or "123456").*/


let password=

function passwordValidation(password) {
    if (password = null) {
